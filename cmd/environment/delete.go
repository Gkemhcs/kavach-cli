		Use:   "delete <name>",
		Short: "üóëÔ∏è Delete an environment by name",
		Long: `Delete an environment and all its associated resources.

This command permanently deletes an environment and all its contents including:
- All secrets stored in the environment
- All provider configurations
- All user groups and member associations
- All role bindings and permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This action is irreversible and will permanently delete all data
associated with the environment. Make sure you have backups if needed.

Prerequisites:
- You must be the owner or admin of the environment
- The environment must not have any child resources (secrets)
- You'll be prompted for confirmation before deletion

The deletion process:
1. Prompts for confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
2. Verifies you have permission to delete the environment
3. Checks for existing child resources (secrets)
4. Permanently deletes the environment and all its data
5. Confirms successful deletion

Examples:
  kavach env delete testing        # Delete environment (with confirmation)
  kavach env list                  # Verify environment is deleted

Note: If the environment contains secrets, you'll need to delete
those first before you can delete the environment.`,

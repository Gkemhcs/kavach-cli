// NewDeleteOrgCommand returns a Cobra command to delete an organization by name.

	return &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "delete <name>",
		Short: "üóëÔ∏è Delete an organization by name",
		Long: `Delete an organization and all its associated resources.

This command permanently deletes an organization and all its contents including:
- All secret groups within the organization
- All environments within those secret groups
- All secrets stored in those environments
- All user groups and member associations
- All role bindings and permissions

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: This action is irreversible and will permanently delete all data
associated with the organization. Make sure you have backups if needed.

Prerequisites:
- You must be the owner of the organization
- The organization must not have any child resources (secret groups, environments)
- You'll be prompted for confirmation before deletion

The deletion process:
1. Prompts for confirmation to prevent accidental deletion
2. Verifies you have permission to delete the organization
3. Checks for existing child resources
4. Permanently deletes the organization and all its data
5. Confirms successful deletion

Examples:
  kavach org delete mycompany        # Delete organization (with confirmation)
  kavach org list                    # Verify organization is deleted

Note: If the organization contains secret groups or environments, you'll need
to delete those first before you can delete the organization.`,

  # Delete organization (will prompt for confirmation)`,

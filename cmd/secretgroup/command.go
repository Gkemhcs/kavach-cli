Secret groups are logical containers that organize related secrets within an organization.
Each secret group can contain multiple environments (like development, staging, production)
and provides a way to manage access control and organization of your secrets.

Key concepts:
- Secret groups belong to organizations and contain environments
- Each secret group can have multiple environments with different configurations
- Secret groups help organize secrets by project, team, or application
- Access control can be managed at the secret group level
- Secret groups can be activated to set a default context for commands

Resource hierarchy:
Organization ‚Üí Secret Groups ‚Üí Environments ‚Üí Secrets

Available operations:
- create: Create a new secret group within an organization
- list: List all secret groups in the current organization
- activate: Set a secret group as the default for future commands
- delete: Delete a secret group and all its environments/secrets
- grant: Grant permissions to users or groups on a secret group
- revoke: Revoke permissions from users or groups on a secret group

Examples:
  kavach group create myapp --description "My application secrets"
  kavach group list                    # List all secret groups
  kavach group activate myapp          # Set myapp as default
  kavach group grant --user john --role admin --group myapp
  kavach group delete myapp            # Delete secret group (with confirmation)`,
	}
